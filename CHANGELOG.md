## [22.10.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`hubStepTrigger` finally draws something.** The directive was exported, listed in the module and
  documented in both READMEs, and the stepper never queried it — so an `ng-template` marked with it
  was captured and then dropped on the floor. It now replaces the trigger the default rail draws,
  once per step, with the step itself as `$implicit` and `title`, `index`, `isCurrent`,
  `isCompleted` and `disabled` in the context. Retiring the directive was the other option and was
  rejected: it is published API with a name that promises exactly this, and the rail already
  rendered its trigger through a parameterised inner template, so connecting it was smaller than
  removing it. `hubStepperNav` still wins where both are present, because a custom rail draws its
  own triggers.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — the CSS block is `hub-stepper`, and the bare `stepper` goes in 23.0.0.** The host
  wore the class `stepper` and named every part under it, including three global `@keyframes`
  called `stepper-fade-in` and friends — and emulated encapsulation does not scope keyframe names,
  so those were identifiers this package planted in every application that installed it. `stepper`
  is a word in the application's namespace, not the library's: a host with a `.stepper` rule of its
  own restyled the component from outside. Every name is now prefixed, as in the rest of the
  family. No class is removed in this release — both spellings are written to the DOM and both are
  matched by the stylesheet — but the old ones are deprecated and go in 23.0.0. The three keyframe
  names are the exception and are renamed outright, with no alias: they were never named in the
  README, the API tables or `FUNCTIONALITIES.md`, so reaching one meant guessing an internal
  identifier out of the compiled stylesheet. [`BREAKING_CHANGES.md`](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md) has
  the full rename list, and the one thing the compatibility window does not cover — the opt-in and
  the flavour have to share a prefix.

### Fixed

- **A control directive buried inside a step no longer makes the stepper render no control at
  all.** `previousButton`, `nextButton` and `submitButton` are content queries, and they ran with
  Angular's default `descendants: true` while `<ng-content select="button[nextButton]">` matches
  only a direct child. So a `button nextButton` inside a step's own form was found by the query and
  could not be projected: the component believed a custom control had been supplied and drew
  nothing, leaving a wizard with no way forward. The three queries are now shallow, which is
  exactly what projection can reach. The buried button keeps working as a control — the directive
  is still applied to it — it simply no longer suppresses the built-in one.

- **The roving focus of the rail is scoped to the rail, and finds a custom trigger.** It queried
  `.stepper__nav-trigger` across the whole host, which would have picked up the tabs of a stepper
  nested inside a step panel, and which finds nothing at all once `hubStepTrigger` draws the
  trigger. It now searches inside the nav only, and accepts `[role="tab"]` as well as either
  spelling of the class.

## [22.9.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **`provideHubStepper(config?: StepperConfig)` — the standalone entry point the rest of the family
  already has** (`provideHubPaginableActions`, `provideToast`, `provideHubSkeletonPresets`). Until now
  `StepperModule.forRoot()` was the only thing that registered the bundled `en` / `es` / `ca` / `eu` /
  `gl` / `ast` / `an` / `de` / `zh` / `ar` dictionaries and the `HubTranslationService` the built-in
  Back / Continue / Submit controls resolve their text through — and the module is removed in 23.0.0.
  So the announced migration cost a consumer either the ten languages, rewritten by hand, or a
  `NullInjectorError` at first render. The new function registers exactly the same providers without a
  module, and `forRoot()` now delegates to it, so the two entry points cannot drift apart.

- **`STEPPER_DICTIONARIES`, the ten bundled dictionaries exported as a plain record.** They were
  internal, which is why the migration note could not hand them over. An application that keeps a
  single translation configuration can now register only the languages it ships, or merge the stepper
  labels into a dictionary of its own, instead of retyping thirty strings. The keys stay flat — `BACK`,
  `CONTINUE`, `SUBMIT` — because that is what the component resolves once its `HUBUI.STEPPER` namespace
  misses; nesting them would silently stop matching.

### Changed

- **The 23.0.0 migration note for `StepperModule.forRoot()` names `provideHubStepper()`** instead of
  sending the reader off to rewrite ten dictionaries. Nothing changes at runtime; what changes is that
  the removal announced in 22.8.2 now has a replacement to point at.

## [22.8.2] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Unit specs for the seven building blocks that had none** — `StepComponent`, the `nextButton` /
  `previousButton` / `submitButton` directives, `StepperNavDirective`, `StepTriggerDirective` and
  `StepperThemeService`. Coverage stopped at `StepperComponent`, so every regression in the pieces
  around it reached a release: an input signal compared instead of read left the projected controls
  permanently disabled, and a selector written with a descendant combinator stopped matching
  altogether. Both are the kind of break the suite now catches on its own, instead of waiting for
  someone to click through the documentation page.

- **`FUNCTIONALITIES.md`** — the library shipped without the coverage matrix its siblings all carry, so
  there was no single place saying which of its features an interactive example actually demonstrates.
- **A migration note for the 22.4.0 removal of the `ng80-stepper` / `ng80-step` selectors.** The CHANGELOG
  flagged it BREAKING, but `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` jumped straight from 22.5.0 to 22.1.0. Since the major
  tracks the Angular major and can never signal a break, that file is the only warning a consumer gets —
  and an unmatched element does not fail loudly, it just stops rendering, which is the worst way to find out.

### Deprecated

- **`StepperModule` and `StepperModule.forRoot()`, marked for removal in 23.0.0.** Neither carried a
  `@deprecated` tag, so an editor gave no hint and neither did the build. The module only re-exports
  the seven standalone building blocks, and importing them directly is the whole migration.
  `forRoot()` needs a word more: it is the only thing that registers the bundled `en` / `es` / `ca` /
  `eu` / `gl` / `ast` / `an` / `de` / `zh` / `ar` dictionaries, and those dictionaries are not part of
  the public API. A standalone application names the three built-in controls through the
  `backLabel` / `continueLabel` / `submitLabel` inputs of `<hub-stepper>`, or registers its own
  dictionary under `HUBUI.STEPPER` with `provideHubTranslation()` from `ng-hub-ui-utils` — which is
  also what supplies the `HubTranslationService` the stepper's `translate` pipe injects. See
  `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Removed

- **The `console.warn` for a step declared without a title and the `console.error` for an out-of-range `goTo()`.** Neither was guarded, so both shipped inside the published bundle and wrote into the console of every consuming application — the first once per untitled step, on every render pass that created one. A library has no business logging into its host's console. Navigation is unchanged: `goTo()` still ignores an index outside the steps collection.

### Fixed

- **Projected `nextButton` and `previousButton` controls no longer arrive permanently disabled.** Both directives compared the adjacent step's `disabled` input signal itself instead of reading its value, so the expression was a function — always truthy — whenever an adjacent step existed. Every custom navigation button a consumer projected was therefore inert and only the built-in controls worked, which is the opposite of what the directives exist for.
- **`StepComponent.isAccessible()` now answers for the step it is asked about.** It negated the `disabled` input signal rather than its value, so it returned `false` for every step, enabled or not, contradicting the contract its own documentation states.
- **`variant="secondary"`, `"neutral"`, `"light"` and `"dark"` are resolved by the stylesheet like the other five built-ins.** The component's built-in list had stayed at the five variants that predate 22.2.0, so the four added then took the custom-accent branch and were written as an inline style, which outranks both a consumer rule and the `hub-stepper-theme()` mixin. The rendered colour was already correct; what changes is that overriding the accent now behaves identically for all nine documented variants.

- **The documentation no longer describes an API the library does not have.** The page and both READMEs
  promised per-step `FormGroup` validation, a completed-steps signal, an orientation input and
  `stepperNavTpt` as the consumer entry point — none of which exist — and gave `'Back'` / `'Continue'` /
  `'Submit'` as the defaults of three inputs that default to `null`. What the library does have and nobody
  had written down is now written down: `variant`, `truncateTitles`, the `stepperNav` rail template and its
  context, the `stepper--animated` / `--anim-slide` / `--anim-fade` host classes, `StepperThemeService`,
  `StepperModule.forRoot()` and the namespaced `HUBUI.STEPPER.*` translation keys.
- Outputs are documented as `OutputEmitterRef`, which is what `output()` returns; the tables still called
  them `EventEmitter`.
- The version banner in both READMEs announced 21.2.1 against a manifest publishing 22.8.2.
- The page's "Recent changes" block skipped eight releases between 22.5.1 and 21.2.0, among them the two
  that introduced `variant` and `truncateTitles`.
- The `stepper-modal` example was registered but unreachable: it appeared in no navigation entry, no
  preview map and no feature group.

## [22.8.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **The `homepage` in the manifest points at this library's own documentation page** rather than at
  the site root. It is the link a registry shows beside the package and the one a reader clicks from
  it, and landing on a front page they then have to search is a worse answer than landing on the
  reference for the package they were already looking at. Metadata only — no code, no types, no
  styles change, and nothing a consumer imports is affected.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Default action labels now resolve `HUBUI.STEPPER.*` before the legacy flat keys.** The component provides the namespace through `HUB_TRANSLATION_PREFIX`, so an application dictionary can feed the built-in navigation labels via `provideHubTranslationAdapter()` without reserving generic top-level keys. Existing flat dictionaries keep working — the bare key is still the fallback.

### Added

- README documentation for the application-wide translation adapter (`provideHubTranslationAdapter()` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`).

### Removed

- **Removed the `@angular/animations` peer dependency.** The package is deprecated upstream and the library never used it. Applications that installed it only for `ng-hub-ui-stepper` can drop it.

## [22.7.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Documentation links now point at the canonical localized URLs. The README linked to `https://hubui.dev/<path>` with no locale prefix and no trailing slash, and both forms are 301-redirected, so every reader arriving from npm or GitHub landed on a redirect instead of the canonical page.

## [22.7.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **`--hub-stepper-indicator-size`** — the canonical step-indicator diameter, `calc(var(--hub-ref-space-3, 1rem) * 2)` by default. The built-in nav renders text-only pill triggers and draws no indicator; this token is the published metric that custom trigger templates and companion step/lifecycle tracks read, so those UIs stop hard-coding `2rem`/`2.5rem` literals — and, being space-derived, a density re-theme moves the indicator together with the paddings and font sizes that already scale (upstream report).

## [22.6.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **WAI-ARIA tablist semantics on the step rail.** The default nav now implements the APG tabs pattern: the rail list is `role="tablist"` with `aria-orientation` (`horizontal` in the default layout, `vertical` in the sidebar layout) and an accessible name; each step trigger is `role="tab"` with `aria-selected`, `aria-current="step"` on the active step, `aria-disabled` on non-navigable steps, and `aria-controls` pointing at the step content panel, now `role="tabpanel"` with `aria-labelledby` back to its tab through stable per-instance generated ids.
- **Keyboard navigation on the step rail.** Roving tabindex makes the rail a single Tab stop: ArrowRight/ArrowLeft (or ArrowDown/ArrowUp) move focus between enabled step tabs — disabled steps are skipped, wrapping around — Home/End jump to the first/last enabled tab, and Enter/Space activates the focused step under exactly the same permission model as clicking its trigger (`canNavigateTo`: any enabled step is reachable). Moving focus never changes the active step (manual activation).
- New `railLabel` input: accessible name of the step rail tablist. Defaults to `'Steps'`.

### Fixed

- The default rail triggers now declare `type="button"`, so a stepper rendered inside a `<form>` no longer submits it when a step trigger is clicked.

## [22.5.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **`StepTriggerDirective` never instantiated.** Its selector used a descendant combinator (`'[hubStepTrigger] [stepTrigger]'`) instead of a comma, so neither attribute alone ever matched. The selector is now `'[hubStepTrigger], [stepTrigger]'` and the directive captures its `TemplateRef` when applied. Note: the stepper does not yet render these trigger templates anywhere — this is groundwork that makes the directive instantiable and queryable; wiring it into the step rail is tracked as follow-up work.

### Changed

- Declared the real `ng-hub-ui-utils` peer range: `>=22.7.0`. The library imports `resolveHubAccent`, introduced in utils 22.7.0; the previous `>=1.2.0` floor allowed installs that compile but fail at runtime.

## [22.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING (packaging) — SCSS ships at `ng-hub-ui-stepper/styles`.** The theme mixin now builds to `dist/stepper/styles/...` (was `dist/stepper/src/lib/styles/...`), so `@use 'ng-hub-ui-stepper/styles'` resolves. Update any `@use` that reached into `src/lib/styles`.

- **`<hub-stepper>` `variant` accepts ANY colour.** On top of the built-in semantic accents, the input now also accepts a **registered custom accent** and a **literal colour** (`#ff0000`, `rgb(...)`, `oklch(...)`, a CSS named colour), resolved through the shared `resolveHubAccent` helper (imported from `ng-hub-ui-utils`): a bareword becomes `var(--hub-sys-color-<name>, <name>)`; a literal is used as-is. The single `--hub-<comp>-accent` slot derives the rest of the family, so built-in colours are unchanged.
- **Internal — host bindings moved to the `host` metadata object.** `@HostBinding` / `@HostListener` decorators were replaced by the `host` object in the component/directive metadata (Angular style guide). No public API or behaviour change.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-06

### Removed

- **BREAKING — legacy `ng80-stepper` / `ng80-step` element selectors removed.** The components now match only `hub-stepper` / `hub-ui-stepper` and `hub-step` / `hub-ui-step`, aligning with the rest of the ng-hub-ui ecosystem (the `hub-ui-*` compatibility alias stays). Replace any `<ng80-stepper>` / `<ng80-step>` markup with `<hub-stepper>` / `<hub-step>`. (Major stays at `22` to track the supported Angular major; this breaking removal ships as a minor bump per the ecosystem's Angular-aligned versioning.)

### Fixed

- CSS variable fallbacks realigned to the ds light defaults (`--hub-sys-color-primary`: `#009ef7` → `#0d6efd`); fallbacks only apply when ng-hub-ui-ds is not loaded. The `transparent` fallback of `--hub-sys-surface-page` on the nav background is intentional degradation and stays unchanged.
- Docs: `docs/css-variables-reference.md` default values resynchronized with the actual code declarations (now guarded by the repo-level `tokens-parity` check F).
- Docs: the README theming example now uses the ds accent (`#0d6efd`) instead of the old-palette blue (`#009ef7`).

## [22.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Opt-in nav title truncation + tooltip.** New `truncateTitles` input on `hub-stepper`: when enabled, each nav step title is clipped to the new `--hub-stepper-nav-title-max-width` CSS variable (default `12rem`) with an ellipsis, and reveals its full text on hover when it overflows. The tooltip is **agnostic** — it defaults to the hub-ui tooltip (via `ng-hub-ui-utils`' `[hubOverflowTooltip]`) but is swappable with `provideHubTooltip(...)`. Off by default, so the standard nav layout is unchanged. Requires `ng-hub-ui-utils >= 22.6.0` and the tooltip styles (`@use 'ng-hub-ui-utils/styles/tooltip';`).

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Open-set accent variants.** `<hub-stepper variant="…">` now accepts the full open accent set out of the box — `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `neutral`, `light`, `dark` (previously only the first five chromatic ones re-based the accent). Any other variant works at runtime with no recompile: define a single `--hub-sys-color-<name>` (e.g. `:root { --hub-sys-color-brand: #ff6b00; }`) and `<hub-stepper variant="brand">` derives the active-pill / controls treatment from it, via the new open-set `[data-variant]` rule.
- New derived accent roles `--hub-stepper-accent-emphasis`, `--hub-stepper-accent-subtle` and `--hub-stepper-accent-on`, mixed locally from the single `--hub-stepper-accent` slot. The active step pill and the next/submit controls now take their text colour from `--hub-stepper-accent-on` instead of a hardcoded white, so a light custom accent stays legible.
- The `hub-stepper-theme()` mixin now re-derives the accent role family whenever its `$accent` parameter is passed, so a brand accent applied on a custom selector recomputes `-emphasis` / `-subtle` / `-on` (the slot stays the single source of truth — no duplication).

### Changed

- The accent role family is now mixed in the **OKLCH** colour space (`color-mix(in oklch, …)`) for perceptually even tints across every accent.

## [22.1.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Design-token consistency pass: aligned inline fallback defaults with the canonical `ng-hub-ui-ds` values and routed hardcoded literals (z-index, font-weight, line-height, radii and theme-aware colours) through their `--hub-sys-*` / `--hub-ref-*` tokens, so they follow the active theme. No visual change when the ds tokens are loaded.

## [22.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- New **`variant` input** on `<hub-stepper>` selecting a **semantic accent**: `<hub-stepper variant="success">` recolours the active step pill and the next / submit controls. The built-in values (`primary` / `success` / `danger` / `warning` / `info`) map to the design-system families via a Sass `@each` loop; **any other string is also accepted** — the accent reads `--hub-sys-color-<variant>`. Defaults to primary (no visual change). New token `--hub-stepper-accent` (the `--hub-stepper-primary-color` and active-pill tokens now follow it).
- New **`hub-stepper-theme()` Sass mixin** (`styles/mixins/stepper-theme`) — theme a stepper in one call: accent, surfaces, nav pills, controls, spacing and the sidebar width. Every parameter is optional and defaults to `null`, so only the ones you pass are emitted as `--hub-stepper-*` overrides. Token-based, no Bootstrap dependency. (Complements the existing `StepperThemeService` for runtime overrides.)
- The `styles/` folder is now shipped inside the package, so the mixin can be consumed directly via `@use 'ng-hub-ui-stepper/styles/mixins/stepper-theme'`.

### Changed

- Replaced the `--hub-stepper-content-padding` and `--hub-stepper-nav-padding` shorthands with the canonical directional `-padding-x` / `-padding-y` tokens. No visual change. **BREAKING**: set the `-x`/`-y` tokens instead of the removed shorthands.

## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Aligned with Angular 22.
- README documentation standardized.


## [21.2.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- `StepperThemeService.setTheme` no longer references the global `document`, which threw `ReferenceError: document is not defined` during server-side rendering. It now injects the `DOCUMENT` token, making runtime theming SSR-safe.

## [21.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- `StepperAnimationDirection` enum exported from `stepper-options.ts` for typed animation direction values (`Forward`, `Backward`).
- Step indexes are now automatically assigned by `StepperComponent` via a reactive `effect()` — no manual `[index]` binding required.

### Changed
- `StepComponent.index` is now an internal writable signal managed by the parent stepper. Remove all `[index]="N"` bindings from `hub-step` templates.
- `StepComponent.disabled` simplified from a getter/setter with a backing `disabled$` signal to a direct signal input (`input(false)`).
- `StepperComponent.currentIndex` is now a public writable signal (`signal<number>`) — call as `currentIndex()` instead of the previous getter.
- Renamed internal signals: `currentIndex$` → `currentIndex`, `contentAnimating$` → `contentAnimating`, `animationDirection$` → `animationDirection` (removed `$` suffix convention).
- Animation direction internally uses `StepperAnimationDirection` enum values instead of raw string literals.

### Removed
- `StepComponent.disabled$` backing signal removed — use the `disabled` signal input directly.
- `[index]` template binding removed from `StepComponent` — indexes are managed internally by the stepper.

## [21.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Integrated **Angular 21** support.
- Implemented **Signals-based** architecture for internal state management.
- Added modern **Input/Output** signal interfaces.
- Added `contentChild` and `contentChildren` for step and directive discovery.

### Changed
- Improved component performance using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support.
- Simplified navigation logic with a more robust step transition system.
- Converted all components and directives to standalone (Angular 20+ default, no `standalone: false`).
- Refactored `StepperModule` to a convenience re-export wrapper with no `declarations`.
- Refactored `NextButtonDirective`, `PreviousButtonDirective`, and `SubmitButtonDirective` to use `computed` signals with `host` bindings, replacing `effect` + `@HostBinding`.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with step indices and validation during dynamic step additions.
- Fixed `steps` template variable incorrectly invoked as a signal inside `ng-template` context (`steps()` → `steps`).
- Fixed `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` (NG0100) in button directives caused by mutating host bindings inside `effect()`.
- Fixed `tsconfig.lib.json`: added `paths` mapping for `ng-hub-ui-utils` to resolve build compilation error.
